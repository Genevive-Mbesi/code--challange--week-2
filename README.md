## Learning Goals
To apply the concepts learned on array iteration, Document Object Module, JavaScript Events, and Server communications by implementing them on a mini web app.

## Introduction
For this challenge, I will be working on Flataculties, an app where you can vote for the cutest animal! I will use a local API and build out the front end for the app.

See a list of all animal names.
Click on an animal's name to see its details.
When adding an animal's details, the user should be able to add the number of votes for an animal.
