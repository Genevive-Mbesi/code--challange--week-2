## Learning Goals
To apply the concepts learned on array iteration, Document Object Module, JavaScript Events, and Server communications by implementing them on a mini web app.

## Introduction
For this challenge, I will be working on Flataculties, an app where you can vote for the cutest animal! I will use a local API and build out the front end for the app.

## Instructions
The data is to be fetched from a local server running a JSON DB server.
A new project folder is created with the following guidelines, The user should be able to  :
See a list of all animal names.
Click on an animal's name to see its details.
When adding an animal's details, the user should be able to add the number of votes for an animal.

## Conclusion
The three pillars of Front-End Web Programming include; Manipulation of the DOM, Recognizing JavaScript Events, and Communicating with the server, this project will help test understanding of these subjects.
